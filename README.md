# Graduation Project  
## Energy Performance Calculation and Survey Platform for Office Buildings

---

## 1. Project Overview

This graduation project focuses on the design and development of a **web-based Energy Performance (EP) Calculation and Survey Platform** for government and commercial office buildings in Vietnam.

The system supports the collection, management, and analysis of building operational data in order to evaluate energy performance and assist decision-making related to energy efficiency and sustainable building management.

The platform allows users to create building profiles, conduct structured energy surveys, calculate energy performance indicators, and export data for reporting and assessment purposes.

## 2. Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Analyse the requirements of an energy performance assessment system for office buildings.
- Design a structured data model for buildings, operational zones, and energy consumption.
- Develop a user-friendly web application for energy surveys.
- Implement automated energy performance calculation logic.
- Provide data export and reporting features.
- Evaluate the system through testing and practical use cases.

## 3. Project Scope

The scope of this project includes:

- Government and commercial office buildings.
- Electricity consumption data and operational schedules.
- HVAC, lighting, and renewable energy information.
- Energy performance calculation at building level.
- Web-based deployment.

The project does **not** include hardware-level measurement or real-time IoT data collection.

## 4. System Architecture

The system follows a **client–server architecture** consisting of:

- **Frontend:**  
  Web interface for survey input, data management, and result visualisation.

- **Backend:**  
  RESTful API handling business logic and energy performance calculations.

- **Database:**  
  NoSQL database for storing building, survey, and calculation data.
