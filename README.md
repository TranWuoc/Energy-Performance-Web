1. Project Overview

This graduation project focuses on the design and development of a web-based Energy Performance (EP) Calculation and Survey Platform for government and commercial office buildings in Vietnam.
The system aims to support the collection, management, and analysis of building operational data in order to evaluate energy performance and assist decision-making related to energy efficiency and sustainable building management.

The platform allows users to create building profiles, conduct structured energy surveys, calculate energy performance indicators, and export data for reporting and assessment purposes. The project combines both theoretical foundations and practical implementation in a full-stack web application.

2. Objectives of the Project

The main objectives of this project are as follows:
	• To analyse the requirements of an energy performance assessment system for office buildings.
	• To design a structured data model for buildings, operational zones, energy consumption, and renewable energy sources.
	• To develop a user-friendly web application that supports energy surveys and EP calculations.
	• To implement automated energy performance calculation logic based on collected data.
	• To provide data visualisation and export features (e.g. Excel reports) to support analysis and reporting.
	• To evaluate the system through testing and practical use cases.

3. Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes:
	• Office buildings (governmental and commercial) as the primary target objects.
	• Energy-related data such as electricity consumption, operational schedules, HVAC systems, lighting systems, and renewable energy.
	• Energy performance calculation at building level based on survey inputs.
	• Web-based deployment for accessibility and scalability.

The project does not focus on hardware-level energy measurement or real-time IoT data collection.

4. System Architecture

The system is designed following a client–server architecture and consists of three main components:
	• Frontend: A web-based user interface for data entry, survey management, and result visualisation.
	• Backend: A RESTful API server responsible for business logic, data processing, and energy performance calculations.
	• Database: A NoSQL database for storing building information, survey data, and calculation results.
